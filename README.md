📝 REQUİREMENTS
Writing an API to communicate with APIs. To show the daily, weekly and monthly weather report according to the country / city information that we will receive from the user.

The request will first come to the API we wrote, then after receiving the request, we will request the Free Weather APIs and return this information.

Build Tool ➡️ Maven

I used Maven because it provides easy tracking of projects thanks to the standard file-directory structure it provides.

I used Lombok when developing Java applications because it is a code generation library with the help of annotation that allows us to write less and cleaner code, facilitate readability
